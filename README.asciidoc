evergreen-php client
====================

This is a PHP library to make requests against an Evergreen system.

This library will compliment opensrf-php and will contain
Evergreen-specific things such as the Fieldmapper and functions
for various Evergreen tasks.

This uses idlchunk and therefore requires Evergreen 2.0 or higher.
